## ProductChecker

ProductChecker is an online product checking application.

It is designed to check the availability and price of products
available on several online retailers. It features the ability
to track availability and price in realtime and provide historical
graphs. 

It also features the ability to be notified in the case where 
products that were previously not in stock, become in stock. 
This functionality utilizes discord webhooks and requires the user
to configure a discord account and accompanying webhook seperately.
